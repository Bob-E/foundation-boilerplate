          ## A note on using this style guide

          ### When to use

          Headings are used to denote different sections of content, usually consisting of related paragraphs and other HTML elements. They range from h1 to h6 and should be styled in a clear hierarchy (i.e., largest to smallest). Il you are looking for a good seo you must respect this :

          - One `h1` per page
          - Follow a logic hierarchy
            - h1
              - p
              - h2
                - h3
                - p
                - h3
                - p
              - h2
              - p

          ### When to use paragraphs

          Paragraphs are groups of sentences, each with a lead (first sentence) and transition (last sentence). They are block level elements, meaning they stack vertically when repeated. Use them as such.

          ### Editing the CSS

          SCSS variables for typography can be found :

          ~~~ scss
          /foundation/scss/foundation/components/_type.scss
          ~~~
